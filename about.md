I am a developer based in Birmingham, UK. I currently work at [buto.tv](http://buto.tv) an awesome Online Video Platform.

This is a place for me to post my thoughts, tutorials and try out new ideas.

I have experience in a wide range of languages and technologies, in particular Javascript and PHP. I am a firm believer in test driven development and writing clean modular code.

You can get in touch with me on twitter [@irfanyasin](https://twitter.com/irfanyasin) or drop me an email at [hello@irfanyasin.com](/contact)
