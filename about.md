I am a developer based in Birmingham, UK. I currently work at [buto.tv](http://buto.tv) an awesome Online Video Platform.

Most days you will find me writing PHP or Javascript but I have experience in a wide range of languages and technologies.

When I am not coding I enjoy

- PHP
- Javascript
- HTML5 / CSS3
- NodeJS
- MySQL
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Linux
- AWS
- Vagrant


```php
<?php

$var = 'this is a test';
```

```javascript
var func = function(param){
    console.log(param);
}
func(param);
```
