Hello.

This is my first post on my new website. I had been thinking of moving my website to Jekyll and have it hosted on GitHub for quite a while now but never got around to it.

I've finally taken the plunge and have to say it is great!

I just want to say thanks to John Otander for the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme, I've made a few modifications but its mostly the same.

Now the blog is all up and running I just have to post every once in a while. Can't be that hard can it :-)
